Raft
===========

Work in progress streaming language, compiler and runtime.  At the moment,
the language is fairly complete.  The front end (parser, lexer) are pretty
much complete.  

Work to be done (still lots):
1. Symbol Table
2. Stream Optimization Visitors
3. Code Generation Visitors -> Implement via LLVM
4. Various middle end pieces (queues, heterogeneous device integration, etc.).
